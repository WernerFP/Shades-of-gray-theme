* userChrome.css *
******************

The file "userChrome.css" contains some firefox adaptations to Shades of gray.
You can copy the file or its content to this location:

~/.mozilla/firefox//<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userChrome.css

If you change a Shades of gray theme color, it is not necessary to copy the file again. You can simply comment out the current theme color and comment in the new theme color value.

* userContent.css *
*******************

Firefox uses the widgets of the current GTK3 theme in websites that have not designed their own widgets for forms.
With dark themes this is ugly and input fields, checkboxes etc. are difficult to use (e.g. black font in dark input fields).
To fix this behavior the file "userContent.css" contains color-neutral form widgets. Copy the file or its contents to this location for enabling:

~/.mozilla/firefox//<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userContent.css
