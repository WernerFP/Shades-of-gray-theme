******************
* userChrome.css *
******************

The file "userChrome.css" contains the Firefox theme for Shades-of-gray.
You can copy the file or its content to this location:

~/.mozilla/firefox//<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userChrome.css

The customizations are based on the dark theme of Firefox, which should be enabled in customize settings

If you change a Shades-of-gray theme color, it is not necessary to copy the file again. You can simply comment the current theme color and uncomment the new theme color value.


*******************
* userContent.css *
*******************

Firefox uses the widgets of the current GTK3 theme in websites that have not designed their own widgets for forms. With dark themes this is ugly and input fields, checkboxes etc. are difficult to use (e.g. black font in dark input fields). To fix this behavior the file "userContent.css" contains color-neutral form widgets.

The file also contains theme customizations for the New Tab page (about:newtab).

Copy the file or its content to this location for enabling:

~/.mozilla/firefox//<name-of-your-profile>/chrome/userContent.css
